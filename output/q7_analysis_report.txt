Mean CVD Outcome CVD by Intervention Group:
 outcome_cvd
    0.336530
    0.319482
    0.333633We see that for the control group, around 33.6 percent of patients experienced a cardiovascular event. For the Treatment B group, around 33.3 percent of patients experineced a cardiovasscular event (this is similar to the control group). For the Treatment A group, around 31.9 percent of patients experienced a cardiovascular event, which is lower than both the Control and Treatment B groups. This suggests that Treatment A offers a slight improvement over control in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events


Mean Adherence by Intervention Group:
 adherence_pct
     60.830686
     60.474255
     61.149013We see that for the control group, around 60.8 percent of patients experienced a cardiovascular event. For the Treatment B group, around 61.1 percent of patients experineced a cardiovasscular event (this is similar to the control group). For the Treatment A group, around 60.5 percent of patients experienced a cardiovascular event. The CVD Rate among all three groups is fairly similar, indicating that Treatment A and Treatment B don't offer a significant improvement beyond the control.
